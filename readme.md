# Blinka's Breakout
This example game is a throw back to an Atari classic [Chips Challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chip's_Challenge). If you remember a game like this but didn't play much Atari perhaps you caught the Microsoft version in the early 90s. 

In this version our pal Blinka must escape from the the level by reaching the heart.

Before you an go to the heart however you must have already collected the robot. But in order to collect the robot you must have gathered all of the chips that are scattered about on the level. 

In doing so one must take care not to go in the water or fire unless they've acquired some proper footwear for Blinka. 

Ice and Conveyor belts will cause Blinka to slide and be pushed along unless Blinka has gotten the appropriate boots.

If you get stuck you can restart the level by pressing Start and then B.

This game serves as a more fully fleshed out example of the [CSV Tilemap Game system](https://hackaday.io/project/168653-csv-tilemap-game)

Try building your own maps by copying and editing the map csv file.
